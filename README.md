# CryptX-Path-Web-Scraping
This repo has been updated!

This includes all the material for Web Scraping using Python!

To download Python, use https://www.python.org/

To use online IDE, use ide.cs50.io

To use the Jupyter Notebooks in this repo, download Jupyter using Python and open these there. Jupyter is very similar to an IDE, but makes learning very easier.

(All the notebooks are taken from Pieren Data, thanks to them.)
