    "Another common idea during a <code>for</code> loop is keeping some sort of running tally during multiple loops. For example, let's create a <code>for</code> loop that sums up the list:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start sum at zero\n",
    "list_sum = 0 \n",
    "\n",
    "for num in list1:\n",
    "    list_sum = list_sum + num\n",
    "\n",
    "print(list_sum)\n",
    "\n",
    "Great! Read over the above cell and make sure you understand fully what is going on. Also we could have implemented a <code>+=</code> to perform the addition towards the sum. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start sum at zero\n",
    "list_sum = 0 \n",
    "\n",
    "for num in list1:\n",
    "    list_sum += num\n",
    "\n",
    "print(list_sum)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 4\n",
    "We've used <code>for</code> loops with lists, how about with strings? Remember strings are a sequence so when we iterate through them we will be accessing each item in that string.\n",
    "\n",
    "for letter in 'This is a string.':\n",
    "    print(letter)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 5\n",
    "Let's now look at how a <code>for</code> loop can be used with a tuple:\n",
    "\n",
    "tup = (1,2,3,4,5)\n",
    "\n",
    "for t in tup:\n",
    "    print(t)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 6\n",
    "Tuples have a special quality when it comes to <code>for</code> loops. If you are iterating through a sequence that contains tuples, the item can actually be the tuple itself, this is an example of *tuple unpacking*. During the <code>for</code> loop we will be unpacking the tuple inside of a sequence and we can access the individual items inside that tuple!\n",
    "\n",
    "list2 = [(2,4),(6,8),(10,12)]\n",
    "\n",
    "for tup in list2:\n",
    "    print(tup)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now with unpacking!\n",
    "for (t1,t2) in list2:\n",
    "    print(t1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cool! With tuples in a sequence we can access the items inside of them through unpacking! The reason this is important is because many objects will deliver their iterables through tuples. Let's start exploring iterating through Dictionaries to explore this further!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example 7\n",
    "\n",
    "d = {'k1':1,'k2':2,'k3':3}\n",
    "\n",
    "for item in d:\n",
    "    print(item)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how this produces only the keys. So how can we get the values? Or both the keys and the values? \n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to introduce three new Dictionary methods: **.keys()**, **.values()** and **.items()**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python each of these methods return a *dictionary view object*. It supports operations like membership test and iteration, but its contents are not independent of the original dictionary – it is only a view. Let's see it in action:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a dictionary view object\n",
    "d.items()\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the .items() method supports iteration, we can perform *dictionary unpacking* to separate keys and values just as we did in the previous examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dictionary unpacking\n",
    "for k,v in d.items():\n",
    "    print(k)\n",
    "    print(v) \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to obtain a true list of keys, values, or key/value tuples, you can *cast* the view as a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "list(d.keys())\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that dictionaries are unordered, and that keys and values come back in arbitrary order. You can obtain a sorted list using sorted():\n",
    "\n",
    "sorted(d.values())"
